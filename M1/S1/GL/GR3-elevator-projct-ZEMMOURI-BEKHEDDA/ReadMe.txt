Elevator Simulator Project :
This project is an elevator simulation that emulates the operation of an elevator system. It involves the control of elevator movements, response to user commands, and coordination of various actions required to fulfill user requests. The simulation includes features such as moving the elevator up and down, responding to emergency stop commands, and managing the opening and closing of elevator doors. The Control-Command component plays a pivotal role in ensuring the smooth operation of the elevator simulation by handling user requests and elevator movements.

Realised by ZEMMOURI Yasmine and BEKHEDDA Hadjira - Group3.
